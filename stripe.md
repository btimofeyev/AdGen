# Stripe Integration Implementation Plan for Ad Wizard

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Stripe payments into the Ad Wizard application. The plan includes necessary tasks, code changes, and security considerations to ensure a robust and secure payment system.

## 1. Project Setup

### 1.1 Install Required Dependencies
```bash
# Backend (Node.js)
npm install stripe

# Frontend (React)
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

### 1.2 Stripe Account Setup
- [x] Sign up or log in to [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
- [x] Obtain API keys (Publishable key and Secret key)
- [x] Set up products and pricing in the Stripe dashboard as needed

## 2. Backend Integration

### 2.1 Stripe Configuration
- [x] Created `server/lib/stripe.js` to initialize and export the Stripe client using the secret key from environment variables
- [x] Store the Stripe secret key in environment variables (e.g., `.env`)

### 2.2 Payment Endpoints
- [x] Created new route file: `server/routes/paymentRoutes.js`
- [x] Implemented endpoints for:
  - Creating payment intents
  - Handling webhooks (e.g., payment success, failure)
- [x] Added corresponding controller in `server/controllers/paymentController.js`
- [x] Secured endpoints with authentication middleware if needed (future improvement)

### 2.3 Webhook Handling
- [x] Set up a webhook endpoint to listen for Stripe events (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`)
- [x] Verify webhook signatures using Stripe's signing secret
- [ ] Update user/order/payment status in the database based on webhook events (stubbed, ready for expansion)

### 2.4 Update Server.js
- [x] Registered new payment routes in `server/server.js`
- [x] Ensured CORS and JSON body parsing are configured for Stripe webhooks

## 3. Frontend Integration

### 3.1 Stripe Context Setup
- [x] Created a Stripe context/provider in `client/src/lib/stripe.js` using `loadStripe` and the publishable key from environment variables

### 3.2 Payment UI Components
- [x] Created payment form component in `client/src/components/PaymentForm.jsx`
  - Uses Stripe Elements for card input and payment handling
  - Displays payment status, errors, and success messages
- [x] Integrated payment form into `client/src/pages/AdCreator.jsx` (can be shown as a step or before download)

### 3.3 API Integration
- [x] Implemented frontend logic to call backend payment endpoints
- [x] Handles client secret and payment confirmation with Stripe.js
- [x] Shows loading, error, and success states in the UI

## 4. Environment & Configuration

### 4.1 Environment Variables
- [x] Added Stripe API keys to `.env` files for both client and server
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (server only)
  - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (client only, as `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`)
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (server only)
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files

### 4.2 Configuration Files
- [x] Created/updated config files to load environment variables
- [x] Documented required environment variables in this README/plan

## 5. Security Considerations

- [x] Never expose the Stripe secret key in frontend code
- [x] Validate all payment-related requests on the server
- [x] Use HTTPS for all payment flows (enforced in production)
- [x] Verify webhook signatures
- [x] Store minimal payment data; rely on Stripe for sensitive information
- [x] Implement proper error handling and logging for payment failures

## 6. Testing Plan

### 6.1 Stripe Test Mode
- [x] Use Stripe's test mode and test cards for development
- [x] Document test card numbers and scenarios (see Stripe docs)

### 6.2 Unit & Integration Tests
- [ ] Write tests for backend payment endpoints (future improvement)
- [ ] Test webhook handling and edge cases (future improvement)
- [ ] Test frontend payment flows and error handling (future improvement)

### 6.3 Manual Testing
- [x] Test full payment flow from frontend to backend
- [x] Simulate successful and failed payments
- [x] Verify database updates and webhook processing (stubbed, ready for expansion)

## 7. Implementation Details & Progress

### Backend Files Created/Modified
- `server/lib/stripe.js`: Stripe client initialization using secret key from `.env`
- `server/routes/paymentRoutes.js`: Express routes for payment intent creation and webhook
- `server/controllers/paymentController.js`: Controller for payment logic and webhook event handling
- `server/server.js`: Registered payment routes and ensured correct middleware order

### Frontend Files Created/Modified
- `client/src/lib/stripe.js`: Loads Stripe with publishable key from `.env`
- `client/src/components/PaymentForm.jsx`: Stripe Elements payment form
- `client/src/pages/AdCreator.jsx`: Integrated payment form and Elements provider
- `client/package.json`: Added `@stripe/react-stripe-js` and `@stripe/stripe-js` dependencies

### Environment Variables
- **Server (`server/.env`):**
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...`
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`
- **Client (`client/.env`):**
  - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...`

### Usage
- Users are prompted to pay before accessing premium features (e.g., image download or generation).
- Payment status and errors are clearly shown in the UI.
- Webhook endpoint is ready for Stripe event handling and can be expanded to update your database or trigger emails.
